# Engineering-THESIS
Arduino, DataBase, QT, Android

This diploma thesis presents the process of creating a plant irrigation system along with a mobile application, which allows controlling the water flow and, in real-time, displaying the parameters present in the garden such as soil moisture, temperature, and atmospheric pressure.
A database was used for the cyclic collection of the read parameters, which also stores the values used to control the system. It acts as a kind of command center, enabling the connection between the operator panel (PC, Android phone) and the modular device with a microcontroller. 
The mobile application was written in the Qt environment, which allows for the construction of cross-platform applications, graphical interfaces, or operator panels. 
The designed device is based on widely available, inexpensive components, which also translate to low maintenance costs. 
The design and development process of the system was constantly accompanied by a sense of the enormous possibilities it offers. Further modifications and development prospects are still possible by increasing the number of electronic modules or adapting the device to new tasks. Depending on individual needs, the mobile application can also be adjusted by adding new functionalities or expanding the current ones â€“ for example, by introducing the possibility of sorting displayed data or statistical comparisons.
